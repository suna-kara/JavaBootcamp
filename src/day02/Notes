OOP:Object oriented programming
         Less code
         Readable
         Reusable

  final keyword: unchangable
         variable: can not be reassigned
         method:  can not be overridden
         class: can not be inherited

  final  vs  finally vs finalize

  Abstraction: Ignore details
               Only functionality will be provided to the user
               hiding the implementation details from the user
               Focus on essentials

               Abstract Method: method without body

                2 ways:
                   1. abstract class: meant to be parent class
                     Ex: BasePage, TestBase


                   2. Interface: blueprint of the class,meant to be implemented
                                 to provide addition methods through the multiple inheritance

                          Ex:
                             WebDriver
                             WebElement
                             TakeScreenShot
                             JavaScriptExecuter
                             ....
                             List
                             Set
                             Collection
                             Map
